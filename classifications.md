•	Violence: Mild violence only. Occasional mild threat or menace only.
•	Imitable techniques: No emphasis on realistic weapons.

•	Theme: More serious issues may be featured, eg crime, domestic violence, racism (providing nothing in their treatment condones them).
•	Language: Mild bad language only.
•	Nudity: Natural nudity, with no sexual context.
•	Sex: Sexual activity may be implied, but should be discreet and infrequent. Mild sexual references and innuendo only.
•	Violence: Moderate violence, without detail, may be allowed - if justified by its setting (eg historic, comedy or fantasy).
•	Imitable techniques: No glamorisation of realistic, contemporary weapons. No detail of fighting or other dangerous techniques.
•	Horror: Frightening sequences should not be prolonged or intense. Fantasy settings may be a mitigating factor.
•	Drugs: No references to illegal drugs or drug use unless entirely innocuous.

•	Theme: Mature themes are acceptable, but their treatment must be suitable for young teenagers.
•	Language: The use of strong language should be rare and must be justified by context.
•	Nudity: Nudity is allowed, but in a sexual context will be brief and discreet.
•	Sex: Sexual activity may be implied. Sexual references may reflect the familiarity of most adolescents today with sex education through school.
•	Violence: Violence must not dwell on detail. There should be no emphasis on injuries or blood. Sexual violence may only be implied or briefly indicated and without physical detail.
•	Imitable techniques: Dangerous techniques (examples include: combat, hanging, suicides) should contain no imitable detail. Realistic and contemporary weapons should not be glamorised.
•	Horror: Sustained threat and menace is permitted. Occasional gory moments only.
•	Drugs: Brief and occasional references to, and sight of, 'soft' drug-taking (eg cannabis) are allowed, but must be justified by context and should indicate the dangers. No instructional elements are permitted.

•	Theme: No theme is prohibited, provided the treatment is appropriate to 15 year olds.
•	Language: There may be frequent use of strong language; the strongest terms are only rarely acceptable. Continued aggressive use of strong language and sexual abuse is unacceptable.
•	Nudity: There are no constraints on nudity in a non-sexual or educational context.
•	Sex: Sexual activity and nudity may be portrayed but without strong detail. The depiction of casual sex should be handled responsibly. There may be occasional strong verbal references to sexual behaviour.
•	Violence: Violence may be strong but may not dwell on the infliction of pain, and of injuries. Scenes of sexual violence must be discreet and brief.
•	Imitable techniques: Dangerous combat techniques such as ear claps, head-butts and blows to the neck are unlikely to be acceptable. There may be no emphasis on the use of easily accessible lethal weapons (in particular, knives).
•	Horror: Sustained or detailed infliction of pain or injury is unacceptable.
•	Drugs: Drug taking may be shown but clear instructive detail is unacceptable. The film as a whole must not promote or encourage drug use.

The Board may, however, cut or reject the following content: - any detailed portrayal of violent or dangerous acts which is likely to promote the activity. This includes also instructive detail of illegal drug use - the more explicit images of sexual activity - unless they can be exceptionally justified by context
